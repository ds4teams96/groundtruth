**Ground Truth** was born due to the need to reduce the lag in the systematization of sentences to do a right follow-up to the orders for *The Special Administrative Unit for the Management of Restitution of Dispossessed Lands* (Unidad Administrativa Especial de Gestión de Restitución de Tierras Despojadas - UAEGRTD) . They claimed that by 2020, they are delay in systematizing around 900 sentences from years between 2013 and 2015.
